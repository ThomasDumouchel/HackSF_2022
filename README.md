This is the project my team and I did at the #ethSanFrancisco hackathon during the weekend of the 5th of november 2022.

Developed a phone application that encourages quality relationships as
opposed to quantity. A relationship is created through a handshake, which is
done by tapping phones between two parties (using NFC). The relationship is
minted as an NFT that deteriorates through time. Relationships are maintained
through further handshakes.
